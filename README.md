*This is a loose clone of the datamapper.org website. Some of the non-doc related stuff has been stripped out, and the code formatting has been cleaned up a bit. I claim no ownership of any of its content, I just need the docs and the site was taken down and redirected around February, 2020. It can be viewed at [https://jimmygle.github.io/datamapper-docs](https://jimmygle.github.io/datamapper-docs)*
