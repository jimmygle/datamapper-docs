<p>DataMapper is always looking for more contributors. When youâ€™ve got an itch to
scratch, jump in and contribute! Write a few specs showing us how your code
works, create a patch and <a href="http://github.com/datamapper/">submit it</a>
as a new ticket or a fix for an existing one. After a few patches and many
thanks, youâ€™ll get commit access.</p>

<p>We benchmark all but the most trivial of patches, because we care about
performance and you should too!</p>

<h2 id="what-we-need">What we need</h2>

<p>Currently DataMapper needs help in a few particular areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>API Documentation (using the <a href="http://www.yardoc.org/"><abbr title="Yet Another Ruby Documentation (tool)">YARD</abbr> documentation style</a>)</li>
  <li>Tutorials (we think the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>
documentation <a href="http://jacobian.org/writing/great-documentation/">guidelines</a> are a good model)</li>
  <li>Bug Reports (we use <a href="https://github.com/datamapper/dm-core/issues/">Github Issues</a>)
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Important</strong>: if you found a bug in a DataMapper project other than
<a href="http://github.com/datamapper/dm-core">dm-core</a>, please use that
projectâ€™s Issue Tracker instead of reporting everything as dm-core
issues</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="git---edge-datamapper">Git - Edge DataMapper</h2>

<p>DataMapper development uses <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> SCM.
Please see <a href="/using-git.html">using git</a> to learn how to contribute.
For detailed instructions how to get a proper development setup for
datamapper up and running, have a look at the <a href="http://github.com/datamapper/dm-dev">edge guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="code-style-guidelines">Code Style Guidelines</h2>
